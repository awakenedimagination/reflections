Q. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A. When you're sharing with someone or collaborating.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A. Because you may be testing changes or not be ready to either show the public or copy onto your working directory.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A. A fork is a clone of someone's repository on github servers. A clone is a local clone or a clone of a repository onto your local system. A branch is new label for separate set of commits.

Q. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A. I could work on it locally, offline.

Q. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

A. Sharing files back and forth by sending zips or working on server. Git & Github is definitely easier, safer, and more efficient.

Q. When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

A. When I'm not sure of the changes, or when they are more experimental. Also, when I don't want to throw a collaborator off. Branches, IMO, are safety nets in a way. They encourage more freely coding and not worrying about "breaking" the code as much.
