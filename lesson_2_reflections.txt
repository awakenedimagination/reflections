Q. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A. It creates a repository and adds a [.git] hidden directory into the directory. Because now I have version tracking enabled, and collaboration possible. :)

Q. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A. It's a "temporary link" between the working directory and the repository. It's valuable because it allows you to bring only certain files into the commit.
